## Mission

You are given a dataset containing information about employees in a company. Each employee record consists of the following attributes: **Name, Department, Salary, and Years of Service**.

Your task is to analyze this dataset and generate a report with the following requirements:
- Identify the average salary for each department.
- Determine the employee with the highest salary in the company.
- Calculate the total years of service for each department.

Here's a sample dataset:
|Name|Department|Salary|Years|
|---:   |---:           |---:   |---:|
|Alice  |HR             |60000  |3|
|Bob	|Engineering	|75000	|5|
|Charlie|Marketing	    |55000	|2|
|David	|Engineering	|80000	|7|
|Eva	|Marketing	    |60000	|4|
|Frank	|HR	            |65000  |6|


Your code should accomplish the following tasks:
1. Read and process the dataset
2. Perform the required calculations

Output a report with:
- The average salary per department
- The employee with the highest salary
- The total years of service per department

## Considerations:
Write clean and modular code\
Choose any programming language and structure your solution as you see fit\
Include tests to validate the correctness of your solution\
Feel free to extend the dataset or add any additional features you find relevant for a more comprehensive solution
